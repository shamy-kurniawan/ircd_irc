New organizational plan:

command.c -- accessed by main loop, still employs an array of struct commands and calls the appropriate callback
	     now contains a function to add in callbacks

X client.c -- registers handlers for the following commands: NICK, USER, MODE, PASS(if ever implemented), OPER(maybe in stat)
O client_stat.c -- registers handlers for the following commands: WHO, WHOIS, WHOWAS (low priority)
O channel.c -- registers handlers for JOIN, PART, INVITE, KICK
O channel_stat.c -- registers handlers for TOPIC, NAMES
X server -- registers handlers for OPER, QUIT, PRIVMSG, PING
O server_stat -- registers handlers for MOTD, VERSION, LUSERS, LIST, INFO
